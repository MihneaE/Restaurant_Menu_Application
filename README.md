# Restaurant_Menu_Application
This is an application that simulates a restaurant menu  and placing an order in it.

To run the application, you must copy the items from the resources folder into the resources folder of your created project, the databases must be copied into the folder with the name of the project, and the rest of the folders must be created in the java folder from src.

The search method no longer works correctly after overwriting the cells in the ListView, without overwriting them it works as it should, I did not manage to identify the error.
